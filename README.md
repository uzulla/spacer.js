## spacer.gif?
* 1x1 transparent gif.
* Good friend for bad html coder.
* Nice friend for old school html.
* ALL Web designers have that.
* but, sometime lost that.
* We can't spend more time create spacer.gif.
* stolen from a site. that's piracy!!!!!!!!
* so, I write this.


## how to use
0. load spacer.js and jquery( i tested with 1.7.2 ).
1. place &lt;img src="spacer.js" width=100 height=100 &gt; to html.
2. call setSpacer() at onload or document ready.


## something else?
This is joke.
